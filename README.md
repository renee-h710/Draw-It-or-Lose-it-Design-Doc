# Draw-It-or-Lose-it-Design-Doc

I work for Creative Technology Solutions (CTS) as a Technology Consultant. My client, The Gaming Room, is interested in a game called Draw It or Lose It. I explained the integration of the clientâ€™s game in a distributed environment, and the pros and cons of each OS, finally giving my recommendation for a Windows setup. 

This software application will be an image rendering of Win, Draw, or Lose It, where players have 30 seconds to identify the slowly-rendering Image before it completes. Gameplay is structured by rounds and opportunities for bonuses. This document outlines the software design for the initial development phase of the game. Requirements are focused on gameplay mechanics, and instance management. This will lay the groundwork for hardware integration.

In the documentation, I analyzed the characteristics, advantages, and weaknesses of each of the big OS's in the industry, which provided useful context for the eventual recommendation of a Windows based enviroment.
Through working on the documentation, I appreciated how clear the direction of coding became. The requirements and constraints especially gives me as a developer the framework for developing the code.
If I could choose one part of the document to revise, I think I would refocus the scope more based on cloud configurations. Overall, I think it is more relevant to base developpment on a cloud based system these days.

The user's needs mapped out the main requirements and constraints, and is integral to development of the application. We need to know what their level of development expertise and resources they are working with, and what functionality is required. From here, we can consider scalibility in future states.
When designing the software, it made sense to use classes to sort out all the parts of the application. in the future, I might do more research on a related application to see a proven setup, instead of coming up with the design myself. It is a priniciple of software design to build upon the expertise of those who came before.
